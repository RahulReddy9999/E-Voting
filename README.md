E-voting systems have gained increasing importance as a means of conducting secure and efficient elections in the digital age. 
research proposes an innovative approach to enhance the integrity and accuracy of the voting process by incorporating face recognition technology through a Resnet model.
The proposed E-voting system utilizes advanced facial recognition algorithms to authenticate registered voters and OTP verification, ensuring that each individual can cast their vote only once. 
The Resnet model is trained on a vast dataset of facial images, enabling it to accurately identify and verify voters in real-time, while also preventing potential instances of voter fraud and impersonation.
